This repository contains the implementation and results of my master thesis on predicting solar irradiance for renewable energy using deep neural network methods.
## **Goal**
The main goal of this project is to develop an accurate solar irradiance prediction model that can be used to optimize the performance of solar energy systems. Three different deep neural network methods are implemented, including **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, and **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, to explore the potential of different architectures for solar irradiance prediction.
## **Data**
The project utilizes available [SkyCam](https://github.com/vglsd/SkyCam): A Dataset of Sky Images and their Irradiance values. This dataset contains solar irradiance, sky images and weather data collected from different weather stations in Switzerland. The data is preprocessed and feature engineered to obtain the input data for the deep neural network models. The performance of the models is evaluated using different metrics, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error.
## **Technologies**
The project is implemented using **Python** programming language and various machine learning libraries, such as **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. The repository contains all the necessary code, data, and results for the project. The code is well-documented and organized into different modules for better readability and modularity.
## **Conclusion**
This project can be useful for researchers and practitioners in the renewable energy industry who are interested in solar irradiance prediction using deep neural network methods. The results of this project can provide insights into the performance of different deep neural network architectures for solar irradiance prediction and help to optimize the performance of solar energy systems.
## **Thanks**
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my master thesis leader, **Ing. Juraj Kačur, PhD.**, for his guidance, expertise, and support throughout the project. His valuable feedback and insightful suggestions have been instrumental in shaping the direction and quality of the project.

I would also like to extend my thanks to the dataset authors, **Evangelos Ntavelis**, **Jan Remund** and **Philipp Schmid**, for providing the private available solar irradiance and weather data used in this project. Their efforts in collecting and publishing the data have made it possible for me to explore the potential of solar energy systems.
